I‚Äôd considered making a social media aggregator application that removes addictive ‚Äúfeatures,‚Äù such as infinite scroll, targeted advertising, and notification badges, but I decided it would not be worth the time since I‚Äôm rarely on Facebook anyway.</div>

Storage Options üîóMy 1TB external HDD would probably be able to store most, if not all, of my digital junk, but the USB connection has deteriorated significantly over the years, and it‚Äôs a gamble every time I plug it in as to whether or not the computer will even recognize the hard drive.</div>

              <div class="summary">I traveled for work almost immediately after starting my first job out of college. However, it was for an unnecessarily-expensive onboarding experience where no meaningful learning happened, no new business was acquired, and no employee under the age of 30 wasn‚Äôt hammered at least 3 times a week. Fun for us recent college grads? Absolutely. Wise investment for the company? Not by a long shot.
My first ‚Äúreal‚Äù business trip occurred in the summer of 2016 when Blackstone Technology Group discontinued their Financial Services offering, spun off their California-based energy industry as a wholly-owned subsidiary, and sent me and one other developer (from the defunct FinTech branch) to the Bay Area for two months.</div>
