      <p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the most successful apps, games, and social media platforms
dedicate considerable effort into making their product addictive. If they
don&rsquo;t, consumers would be less likely to use their product, making it less
valuable to advertisers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d considered making a social media aggregator application that removes
addictive &ldquo;features,&rdquo; such as infinite scroll, targeted advertising, and
notification badges, but I decided it would not be worth the time since I&rsquo;m
rarely on Facebook anyway. (And yes, rebranded or no, it will always be
&ldquo;Facebook&rdquo; as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.)</p>
<p>Instead, I&rsquo;d like to dedicate that time to implement a similar idea to my own
workspace; to be annoying by design.</p>
<p>My hope is that the features on which I want to have had spent less time
focusing are designed in such a way as to be accessible but not too accessible.
For example, I want to spend more time focusing on reading the Bible, and less
time focusing on stock prices. So if I have a TV display, I might have it
display Bible passages as a screensaver or default view. Then, in order to
display stock prices, I could configure the TV such that I would have to hold a
button down that, when released, would revert back to the default display.</p>
<p>In her &ldquo;Tidying Up&rdquo; show, Marie Kondo suggests putting the &ldquo;keep&rdquo; pile of
clothes on the other side of the room as a small extra barrier to keeping
stuff. The upside to the horrific impact of the internet age on humans'
patience is that a simple thing like a 1-second delay can now be leveraged as
an effective barrier to entry.</p>
<p>Apps advertise themselves as systems that &ldquo;Just Work™&rdquo; (trademark symbol and
everything) because they want zero barriers to entry: Stupid-proof. I want to
make it so that I have to work harder to develop unhealthy habits and harder to
avoid good content.</p>
