      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that the most successful apps, games, and social media platforms dedicate considerable effort into making their product addictive. If they don&amp;rsquo;t, consumers would be less likely to use their product, making it less valuable to advertisers.
I&amp;rsquo;d considered making a social media aggregator application that removes addictive &amp;ldquo;features,&amp;rdquo; such as infinite scroll, targeted advertising, and notification badges, but I decided it would not be worth the time since I&amp;rsquo;m rarely on Facebook anyway.</description>

      <description>After years of creating &amp;ldquo;photo dump&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;temp&amp;rdquo; directories to clear space on devices, I finally decided to make time to organize as many of my digital assets as best as I could. I knew I had hundreds of GB of stuff, probably closer to 2 TB.
Storage Options ðŸ”—My 1TB external HDD would probably be able to store most, if not all, of my digital junk, but the USB connection has deteriorated significantly over the years, and it&amp;rsquo;s a gamble every time I plug it in as to whether or not the computer will even recognize the hard drive.</description>

      <title>Grade Calculator</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re in school and, like me, enjoy playing the &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; game with your grades, you might find this fun and/or helpful.
The faded green range shows your minimum and maximum course grade for finalized assignment/test grades. The light green range shows your &amp;ldquo;hypothetical&amp;rdquo; grade range, based on grades you enter as &amp;ldquo;not final.&amp;rdquo; Eventually I plan to make this into mobile app, but for now, Google Sheets works pretty well.</description>

      <description>In preparation for a Spartan Sprint in 2016, I subscribed to their &amp;ldquo;Workout of the Day.&amp;rdquo; I wanted to pull it up on my phone without having to go to their website or search through my inbox, so I took a closer look at the Workout of the Day web page and found an API link I might be able to use.
 You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait 13 seconds and download 10 MB of ads, images, and popups just to view 630 bytes of text.</description>

      <title>Business Trip Lessons</title>

      <description>I traveled for work almost immediately after starting my first job out of college. However, it was for an unnecessarily-expensive onboarding experience where no meaningful learning happened, no new business was acquired, and no employee under the age of 30 wasn&amp;rsquo;t hammered at least 3 times a week. Fun for us recent college grads? Absolutely. Wise investment for the company? Not by a long shot.
My first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; business trip occurred in the summer of 2016 when Blackstone Technology Group discontinued their Financial Services offering, spun off their California-based energy industry as a wholly-owned subsidiary, and sent me and one other developer (from the defunct FinTech branch) to the Bay Area for two months.</description>
