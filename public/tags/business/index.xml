      <description>I traveled for work almost immediately after starting my first job out of college. However, it was for an unnecessarily-expensive onboarding experience where no meaningful learning happened, no new business was acquired, and no employee under the age of 30 wasn&amp;rsquo;t hammered at least 3 times a week. Fun for us recent college grads? Absolutely. Wise investment for the company? Not by a long shot.
My first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; business trip occurred in the summer of 2016 when Blackstone Technology Group discontinued their Financial Services offering, spun off their California-based energy industry as a wholly-owned subsidiary, and sent me and one other developer (from the defunct FinTech branch) to the Bay Area for two months.</description>
